                        <span class="wk1_answer">It is this simple games rule the market.  Consumers like having fun with devices a fingertip away.  No matter where the country is.</span>

                        <span class="wk1_answer">Well according to the chart looks like the overall distribution for Gingerbread API 10 is 60.3.  Which according to the numbers is fairly high for all three countries.  Not to mention that it has been on the market for a significant amount of time and is stable.  With the release of Ice cream sandwich API 14-15-16 and a distribution of 15.8% those numbers will change.  Considering that Ice cream was just released not too long ago that is not bad.  Having a mess of a time finding individual stats.</span>

                        <span class="answer">Answer:</span>
                        <span class="wk1_answer">To be honest anyone that is good at coding, imaginative, and love gaming, of course creating a kool game would be profitable.  Not only would it be profitable but if the game is popular in the top main countries it can become a game changer.  I am not a gamer at all period.  My goal is literature and ecommerce.  I love books thats my weakness and my passion.  And ecommerce, such as stores, ebooks, and banking.  That is the direction I'm leaning towards.</span>
